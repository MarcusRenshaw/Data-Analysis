# Data-Analysis
Several scripts for the analysis of data from Bolsig-Minus simulations

He-Hy-O-N-swarm_analysis.py is an example of a Python script that takes the data files saved by Bolsig minus, converts the data into
arrays and plots them or saves them to a large database in csv format for use in Bokeh.

Bokeh is an interactive data visualization tool that allows vast qunatities of data to be viewed and understood very efficiently.
Bokeh can be run through Jupyter Notebook. Attached is a text file, "mobility.txt" which is the code for running interactive visulization of the data collected in the swarm analysis script.
